////
The strategy elements are typically used to model the strategic direction and choices of an enterprise, as far as the impact on its architecture is concerned. They can be used to express how the enterprise wants to create value for its stakeholders, the capabilities it needs for that, the resources needed to support these capabilities, and how it plans to configure and use these capabilities and resources to achieve its aims. Strategy elements are used to model the strategic direction and choices of the enterprise, whereas Business Layer elements are used to model the operational organization of an enterprise.

*Why* one should consider this strategy

Most SAP services are deployed on-premises with well-established procedures, but significant planning must go into these deployments.  For example, workload growth must be estimated and planned for in hardware requirements, often several years in advance.

Predicting the future is not easy.  When considering requirements, such as storage capacity, many factors may affect the system over its lifespan.  Selections often end up being just "best guesses."

With today's quickly changing environments, many businesses need to accelerate innovation and increase agility across their entire landscape in order to achieve a faster time-to-market and manage costs.  Migrating products and services to the cloud can help businesses become more flexible and agile to meet changing business demands.

With moving products and services into the cloud, a modern trend in organizations, businesses meet changing demands and become flexible and agile in making business decisions.

One key benefit of the cloud is that a business no longer needs to plan hardware sizing for the next five or more years.  Larger, faster, or even smaller infrastructure is only one reboot away.

However, "rightsizing" (or infrastructure optimization) remains an important consideration.  Businesses that actively manage "rightsizing" their environment can cut operating costs by 30 to 60 percent.

=== Context

There are many benefits gained when moving SAP workloads to the cloud:

Quick deployment:: If you need fast application implementation and deployment, the cloud is the best choice. You can set up a cloud environment within a few hours, whereas, in-house IT infrastructure can take days or even  months to order, install, configure, and bring online.  With the cloud and SUSE's automation solution for SAP, IT teams can easily configure and manage the setup remotely.

Reduce Costs:: Many businesses experience large CapEx (Capital Expenditure) to maintain IT infrastructure, with purchases often in advance of actual need.  SUSE, together with the cloud providers, help businesses transform to a more efficient OpEx (Operating Expenditure) model, with ‘pay as you use’ options that empower businesses with greater agility.
 
Scalability & Flexibility:: With the cloud and the ability to use pay-as-you-go subscriptions, businesses can scale up or scale down resources as needed.  It is much easier to "rightsize" and ensure an efficient environment that meets changing business demands.

Maintenance:: In the cloud, IT departments no longer have to worry about managing and maintaining the hardware and underlying infrastructure.  The cloud service provider handles this, freeing up company resources to focus on innovation and other business needs.
      
Resiliency:: Uptime is of prime importance to ensure day-to-day business operations run smoothly.  Moving to the cloud maximizes uptime and reduces downtime.
The cloud improves disaster recovery and business continuity without the need to spend a huge amount of capital on robust disaster recovery tools.  Cloud providers offer a variety of services to help protect businesses from security threats and outages.  SUSE's SAP HA automation augments these services to further reduce downtime of SAP applications.

Remote access:: The cloud allows employees to access data from anywhere and at any time, making business more flexible and increasing productivity.  SUSE products natively provide many options for remote access and control.


Overall, SUSE and public clouds offer significant benefits for all customers, regardless of size.  The use of cloud resources can lower infrastructure costs and improve the scalability, agility, flexibility, and availability of SAP applications.
