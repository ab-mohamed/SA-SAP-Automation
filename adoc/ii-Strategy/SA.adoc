== Strategy

////
The strategy elements are typically used to model the strategic direction and choices of an enterprise, as far as the impact on its architecture is concerned. They can be used to express how the enterprise wants to create value for its stakeholders, the capabilities it needs for that, the resources needed to support these capabilities, and how it plans to configure and use these capabilities and resources to achieve its aims. Strategy elements are used to model the strategic direction and choices of the enterprise, whereas Business Layer elements are used to model the operational organization of an enterprise.

*Why* one should consider this strategy
////

Most SAP services are deployed on-premises with well-established procedures, but it is important to plan and size the required hardware several years ahead and estimate the maximum workload e.g. for the next 5 years. 

It is dificult to predict the future, so when considering requirments such as capacity, as there are many factors which may affect this over the system lifespan, the values selected for this often ends up being a 'best guess'.

Today, with quickly changing environments, many businesses need to accelerate innovation and increase agility across their business.  This allows them to acheive a faster time-to-market in addition to lowering costs.

////
With moving products and services into the cloud, a modern trend in organizations, businesses meet changing demands and become flexible and agile in making business decisions.
////

One key example here is that you no longer need to plan the hardware sizing for the next 5 years, as a larger, faster or even smaller infrastructure is only one reboot away. 

"Rightsizing" or infrastructure optimization remains an important task and should be front of mind when managing an SAP Landscape in the cloud. Not takeing care of this cloud benefit could have large cost implications, companies that “rightsize” their workloads are often able to cut costs by of 30-60%.

=== Context

There are many benefits gained when moving your SAP workloads to the cloud:

Quick deployment:: If you need fast application implementation and deployment, cloud is the best choice. You can set up a cloud environment within a few hours, whereas, in-house IT infrastructure set-up takes days and sometimes months to order it and set up. With the cloud, IT teams can easily configure and manage the setup remotely.
+    
This is the area where SUSE's automation solution for SAP can help.

Reduce Costs:: Many businesses spent a lot of their capital on maintaining their IT Infrastructure. With help of the cloud, they can transform their CapEx (Capital Expenditure) to stable OpEx (Operating Expenditure).
Costs can be controlled as the cloud model is a ‘pay as you use’ scenario and many cloud vendors provide several consumption options to provide more choice to their customers. 
+    
This is an area where SUSE can help together with the cloud provider to offer the right options, but this also means you need to adapt how you use the resources and the SAP software.
 
Scalability & Flexibility:: With the cloud, you can scale up your system as and when required, add or remove resources when the business demands it and as mentioned above, "rightsizing" and instance optimization to provide an efficient solution.
+    
////
With SUSE ready to run images available in the cloud providers marketplace it is easy to scale.

Maintenance:: With the public cloud, IT departments no longer have to worry about managing and maintaining the hardware and underlying infrastructure, the cloud service provider handles this for your organization and frees up company resources to focus on other business acivities.
      
Resiliency:: For businesses these days, uptime is of prime importance to ensure day-to-day business operatinos run smoothly. Moving to the cloud maximizes uptime and reduces downtime.
The cloud improves disaster recovery and business continuity without the need to spend a huge amount of capital on robust disaster recovery tools.  Cloud providers offer a variety of services to help protect businesses from any security threat or outage.

+
SUSE's SAP HA Automation can add to these services to provide less downtime of your SAP application.
    
Remote access:: With the cloud, your employees can access data from anywhere, and at any time via the internet making business more flexible and increase the productivity of the employees.
+    
SUSE products natively provides many options for remote access and control.
    
So overall, public clouds offer significant benefits for all customers regardless of size. The use of public cloud resources can lowerb infrastructure costs and improve the scalability, agility, flexibility and availablity of applications.
