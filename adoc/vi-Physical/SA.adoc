The SAP automation consist, as we have see before, out of several building blocks. 
First we want to look at the infrastructure deployment with terraform

=== First make sure that all *pre-requirements* are done:

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]

. Have an Azure account 
. Have installed the Azure commandline tool _az_
. Have installed _terraform_ (v12) (it comes with SLES within the public cloud module)
. Have the SAP HANA install media downloaded from SAP
. Have created an Azure File Share
. Copy or write down the the name of the storage account and the storage key, which is similar to a password.
. Copy the SAP HANA install media to the Azure fileshare
. extract the install media

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
AWS - S3 bucket
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP - GCP storage
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Libvirt" ]
Libvirt - NFS share
endif::[]

As suggestion, we recommend the following directory structure:
//fixme directory structure
----
share+
     + HANA
     |  + xxxxxxx 
     |
     + NW
        + sapkernel
        + export
        + client
        + swpm
----
        

=== Get the project from the github site

The project is hosted on a public github site where you can download it to your local machine.

After moving into this directory you will see the following directory structure:

----
├── aws
├── azure
├── doc
├── gcp
├── generic_modules
├── libvirt
├── LICENSE
├── pillar
├── pillar_examples
├── README.md
└── salt
----

The directories with the names of the cloud provider are the terraform templates for the relevant provider. 

The pillar, pillar_examples and the salt directory contain the part of the salt configuration management.


=== Terraform

Terraform relies on so called "providers" to interact with remote systems.

Providers are plugins and released independent from Terraform itself, this mean that each provider has its own series of version numbers.

Each Terraform module must declare which providers it requires, so that Terraform can install and use them.

The directory _generic_modules_ provides modules which get used by all cloud vendor templates, like common variables, local executed functions within the building block, dependent actions on destroy and the functions to start the SALT execution on the module building blocks.

The _vendor_ directory consist of one directory (modules) and several .tf files which all together build the terraform template.

----
├── infrastructure.tf
├── main.tf
├── modules
├── outputs.tf
├── README.md
├── terraform.tfvars
├── terraform.tfvars.example
└── variables.tf
----

The _infrastructure.tf_ file:: provides the cloud specific setup with the cloud relevant provider module of terraform and defines all the needed cloud specific entities.

The _main.tf_ file:: provides all the values for the various variables needed for the modules.

The _output.tf_ file:: provides the values handed out from the modules, e.g to be used or displayed.

_terraform.tfvars__:: is a variable definitions file which get automatically loaded instead of providing values manually

_terraform.tfvars.example_:: is a example file with many pre-filled key-value pairs to set up
the solution. You can use this as starting point for your own file.

_variables.tf_:: provides all used input variables, including a short description, the type of the variable and a default value which can be overwritten with the terraform.tfvars file.

A _module_:: is a container for multiple resources that are used together. Modules can be used to create lightweight abstractions, so that you can describe your infrastructure in terms of its architecture, rather than directly in terms of physical objects.

We use the modules as our technical building blocks e.g. a HANA node and the module directory consist again  _main.tf_, _variables.tf_, _outputs.tf_.

These are the recommended filenames for a minimal module, even if they're empty. _main.tf_ is the primary entrypoint how to build the infrastructure building block.
There is one additional file, which take care of handing over the needed values to the salt building blocks, with help of a special terraform resource called _null_provider_, and  remote execute the salt run to configure the instances and execute the application installation for the building block.




The _infrastructure.tf_ provides the network setup with vnet,subnet and routing, the resourcegroup used, a storage account, the network security groups (nsg) being used and defines the jumphost.

There is the (default) possibility to autogenerate network addresses for all nodes.
For that you need to remove or comment all the variables related to the ip addresses (more information in variables.tf). With this approach all the addresses will be retrieved based in the provided virtual network addresses range (vnet_address_range).

AWS has a pretty specific way of managing the addresses. Due to its architecture, each of the machines in a cluster must be in a different subnet to have HA capabilities. Besides that, the Virtual addresses must be outside of VPC address range too.

Example based on `10.0.0.0/16` address range (VPC address range) and `192.168.1.0/24` as `virtual_address_range` (the default value):

If you want to use already existing network resources (virtual network and subnets) it can be done by configuring the terraform.tfvars file and adjusting the responsible variables. 

+The example of how to use them is available at terraform.tfvars.example.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are specifying the IP addresses manually, make sure these are valid IP addresses. They should not be currently in use by existing instances. In case of shared account usage in cloud providers, it is recommended to set unique addresses with each deployment to avoid using same addresses.

==== SAP Sizing

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]

To make it easier to deploy the right instance sizes with the right disks types and performance, and the right network settings, we introduced a simplified SAP sizing which well known T-Shirt sizes, S,M,L and a very small Demo size.

Behind the sizes, are useful combinations to provide certain SAP performance scenarios. 
Below is a simple reference of the possible performance values 

* Demo
* Small  <  30.000 SAPS
* Medium <  70.000 SAPS
* Large  < 180.000 SAPS

You can simply customize the used settings within the terraform.tfvars, or more permanent in the variables file.

The Demo and Small size are thought for non-production scenarios and do not use SAP certified instancetypes, whereas the Medium and Large are meant for production usage and therefor use SAP certified instance types. The setups also used the right disks and I/O behavior for production.


===== HANA

The map below, describes how the disks for SAP HANA will be used and created during the provisioning. Given that low storage latency is critical for database systems, even for in-memory systems as SAP HANA. The critical path in storage is usually around the transaction log writes of the DB systems, but other operations like savepoints or loading data in-memory after crash recovery can be critical. 

Therefore, it is mandatory to leverage Azure premium storage or Ultra disk for /hana/data and /hana/log volumes. Depending on the performance requirements, we may need to build a RAID-0 stripe-set to aggregate IOPS and throughput to meet the application scenario need.

The overall VM I/O throughput and IOPS limits need to kept in mind when deciding for a instance type.






Actual recommendations could be looked at the following link
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations-storage



disks_type:: as HANA has high I/O requirements the disk type Premium SSD need to be used
disks_size:: is the size of the additional disk in GB, as every size has certain IOPS caps
caching:: The caching recommendations for Azure premium disks are assuming the I/O 
characteristics for SAP HANA
/hana/data - no caching or read caching
/hana/log - no caching - exception for M- and Mv2-Series VMs where Azure Write Accelerator should be enabled
/hana/shared - read caching

writeaccelerator:: Azure Write Accelerator is a functionality that is available for Azure M-Series VMs exclusively. As the name states, the purpose of the functionality is to improve I/O latency of writes against the Azure premium storage. For SAP HANA, Write Accelerator is supposed to be used against the /hana/log volume only. Therefore, the /hana/data and /hana/log are separate volumes with Azure Write Accelerator supporting the /hana/log volume only.

Number of Disks::

LogicalVolumes::  We are using LVM to build stripe sets across several Azure premium disks.These stripe sizes differ between /hana/data and /hana/log and the recommendations is 
256 KB for /hana/data
64 KB for /hana/log

Name of the VolumeGroup:: 

Mount path:: 

The number of elements *must match* in all of them

    "#" character is used to split the volume groups, while "," is used to define the logical volumes for each group
    
    The number of groups splitted by "#" *must match* in all of the entries
    
    names -> The names of the volume groups (example datalog#shared#usrsap#backup#sapmnt)
    
    luns  -> The luns or disks used for each volume group. The number of luns must match with 
        the configured in the previous disks variables (example 0,1,2#3#4#5#6)
    
    sizes -> The size dedicated for each logical volume and folder (example 70,100#100#100#100#100)
    
    paths -> Folder where each volume group will be mounted (example /hana/data,/hana/log#/hana/shared#/usr/sap#/hana/backup#/sapmnt/)
