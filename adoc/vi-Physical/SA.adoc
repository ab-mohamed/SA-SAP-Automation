The SAP automation consist, as we have see before, out of several building blocks.
First we want to look at the infrastructure deployment with terraform

=== First make sure that all *pre-requirements* are done:

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]

. Have an Azure account
. Have installed the Azure commandline tool _az_
. Have installed _terraform_ (v12) (it comes with SLES within the public cloud module)
. Have the SAP HANA install media downloaded from SAP
. Have created an Azure File Share
. Copy or write down the the name of the storage account and the storage key, which is similar to a password.
. Copy the SAP HANA install media to the Azure fileshare
. extract the install media

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
AWS - S3 bucket
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP - GCP storage
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Libvirt" ]
Libvirt - NFS share
endif::[]

As suggestion, we recommend the following directory structure:
//fixme directory structure
----

  ├─ HANA
  │    └─ ...
  └─ Netweaver
       ├─ sapkernel
       │    ├─ ...

=== Get the project from the github site

The project is hosted on a public github site where you can download it to your local machine.

After moving into this directory you will see the following directory structure:

----
├── aws
├── azure
├── doc
├── gcp
├── generic_modules
├── libvirt
├── LICENSE
├── pillar
├── pillar_examples
├── README.md
└── salt
----

The directories with the names of the _cloud provider_ (aws,azure,gcp,libvirt) are the terraform templates for the relevant provider.

The _doc_ directory has some short but important documents for certain parts of the solution

The directory _generic_modules_ provides modules which get used by all cloud vendor templates, like common variables, local executed functions within the building block, dependent actions on destroy and the functions to start the SALT execution on the module building blocks.

The other directories _pillar_, _pillar_examples_ and _salt_ contain the part of the salt configuration management.


=== Terraform Building Blocks

Terraform relies on so called "providers" to interact with remote systems.

Providers are plugins and released independent from Terraform itself, this mean that each provider has its own series of version numbers.

Each Terraform module must declare which providers it requires, so that Terraform can install and use them.

If we switch to into a _cloud provider_ directory, we see one directory _modules_ and several _.tf_ files which all together build the terraform template.

When creating Terraform configurations, it's best practice to separate out parts of the configuration into individual .tf files. This provides better organization and readability.
----
├── infrastructure.tf
├── main.tf
├── modules
├── outputs.tf
├── README.md
├── terraform.tfvars
├── terraform.tfvars.example
└── variables.tf
----

The _infrastructure.tf_ file:: provides the cloud specific setup with the cloud relevant provider module of terraform and defines all the needed cloud specific entities.

The _main.tf_ file:: provides all the values for the various variables needed for the modules.

The _modules_ directory:: provides more subdirectories which are the nested child modules which represent our technical building blocks

The _output.tf_ file:: provides the values handed out from the modules, e.g to be used or displayed.

_terraform.tfvars__:: is a variable definitions file which get automatically loaded instead of providing values manually and is the main file and maybe the only terrafrom file which should get changed.

_terraform.tfvars.example_:: is a example file with many pre-filled key-value pairs to set up
the solution. *You can use this as starting point for your own file.*

_variables.tf_:: provides all used input variables, including a short description, the type of the variable and a default value which can be overwritten with the terraform.tfvars file.


A _module_:: is a container for multiple resources that are used together. Modules can be used to create lightweight abstractions, so that you can describe your infrastructure in terms of its architecture, rather than directly in terms of physical objects.
+
We use the modules as our technical building blocks e.g. a HANA node and the module directory consist again  _main.tf_, _variables.tf_, _outputs.tf_.
+
These are the recommended filenames for a minimal module, even if they're empty. _main.tf_ is the primary entrypoint how to build the infrastructure building block.
There is one additional file, which take care of handing over the needed values to the salt building blocks, with help of a special terraform resource called _null_provider_, and  remote execute the salt run to configure the instances and execute the application installation for the building block.


==== Terraform file details

All files in the Terraform directory using the .tf file format will be automatically loaded during operations.

The _infrastructure.tf_ provides the _data sources_ for the network setup, which are computed in other terraform parts and some _locals_ variables used for mainly for the autogeneration of the network. In addition it provides the _resources_ for the network setup with virtual network, the needed subnet and routing, the needed resourcegroup to be used, a storage account, the all the network security groups (nsg) being used and defines the jumphost.

The _main.tf_ file is our main file and calls the child modules which consist of our building blocks and the required input and output variables defined by the child module.
It in addition provides the calculation for the autogenerated ip addresses.

There is the (default) possibility to autogenerate network addresses for all nodes.
For that you need to remove or comment all the variables related to the ip addresses (more information in variables.tf). With this approach all the addresses will be retrieved based in the provided virtual network addresses range (vnet_address_range).

Within AWS, the Availability Zones (AZ) of a VPC get used for the HA scenario.
Each of the AZ's has it's own network and therefore each of the machines in a cluster is in a different subnet. The floating virtual IP address is created with help of a special resource agent which changes the routing table entry of a virtual router for VPC, so the adress is outside of the VPC and AZ's

If you want to use already existing network resources (virtual network and subnets) it can be done by configuring the _terraform.tfvars_ file and adjusting the responsible variables.

The example of how to use them is available at _terraform.tfvars.example_.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are specifying the IP addresses manually, make sure these are valid IP addresses. They should not be currently in use by existing instances. In case of shared account usage in cloud providers, it is recommended to set unique addresses with each deployment to avoid using same addresses.
====

The _output.tf_ file is a way to expose some of the internal attributes, and act like the return values of a terraform module to the user. It will return the IP address and node names created from the automation.

The values defined in the _variables.tf_ file are used to avoid hard-coding parameters and provides all needed terraform input variables and there default values within the solution instead of having them in the main.tf file.

As we have many variable values to input, so we define them in a variable definition file named _terraform.tfvars_ and terraform will automatically load the variable values from the variable definition file if it is named terraform.tfvars


==== SAP Sizing

One of the very important points to consider of a SAP deployment is Sizing and applies across three key areas: compute power, storage space and i/o capacity and network bandwith.

If this is a greenfield deployment, please use the SAP Quick Sizer tool to calculate the SAP Application Performance Standard (SAPS) compute requirement and choose the right instance types which have the closest match to the performance needed.

If you have an SAP system running that you want to extend with new functionality and/or add new users or migrate to SAP HANA perform brownfield sizing.

Overall it is an iterative and constant process to translate your business requirements to  the right (virtual) hardware resources.

This is a mandatory step and should not be underestimated.


ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]

If you have some performance number, we want to make it easier to deploy the right instance sizes with the right disks types and performance, and the right network settings, we introduced a simplified SAP sizing which well known T-Shirt sizes, S,M,L and a very small Demo size.

Behind the sizes, are useful combinations to provide certain SAP performance scenarios.
Below is a simple reference of the possible performance values

* Demo
* Small  <  30.000 SAPS
* Medium <  70.000 SAPS
* Large  < 180.000 SAPS

You can simply customize the used settings within the terraform.tfvars, or more permanent in the variables file.

The Demo and Small size are thought for non-production scenarios and do not use SAP certified instancetypes, whereas the Medium and Large are meant for production usage and therefor use SAP certified instance types. The setups also used the right disks and I/O behavior for production.

The SAPS values are meant for the landscape and not only for the database.


===== HANA

Given that low storage latency is critical for database systems, even for in-memory systems as SAP HANA. The critical path in storage is usually around the transaction log writes of the DB systems, but other operations like savepoints or loading data in-memory after crash recovery can be critical.

Therefore, it is mandatory to leverage Azure premium storage or Ultra disk for /hana/data and /hana/log volumes. Depending on the performance requirements, we may need to build a RAID-0 stripe-set to aggregate IOPS and throughput to meet the application scenario need.

The overall VM I/O throughput and IOPS limits need to kept in mind when deciding for a instance type.

Actual recommendations could be looked at the following link
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations-storage

The maps below, describes how the disks for SAP HANA will be used and created during the provisioning.

disks_type:: as HANA has high I/O requirements the disk type Premium SSD need to be used
disks_size:: is the size of the additional disk in GB, as every size has certain IOPS caps
caching:: The caching recommendations for Azure premium disks are assuming the I/O
characteristics for SAP HANA
/hana/data - no caching or read caching
/hana/log - no caching - exception for M- and Mv2-Series VMs where Azure Write Accelerator should be enabled
/hana/shared - read caching

writeaccelerator:: Azure Write Accelerator is a functionality that is available for Azure M-Series VMs exclusively. As the name states, the purpose of the functionality is to improve I/O latency of writes against the Azure premium storage. For SAP HANA, Write Accelerator is supposed to be used against the /hana/log volume only. Therefore, the /hana/data and /hana/log are separate volumes with Azure Write Accelerator supporting the /hana/log volume only.

Number of Disks::

LogicalVolumes::  We are using LVM to build stripe sets across several Azure premium disks.These stripe sizes differ between /hana/data and /hana/log and the recommendations is
256 KB for /hana/data
64 KB for /hana/log

Name of the VolumeGroup:: The name of the volume group used

Mount path:: The mount point where the volume gets mounted

The number of elements *must match* in all of them

_#_ character:: is used to split the volume groups
_,_ (comma):: is used to define the logical volumes for each volume group

The number of groups splitted by "#" *must match* in all of the entries

_names_:: The names of the volume groups (example datalog#shared#usrsap#backup#sapmnt)

_luns_:: The luns or disks used for each volume group. The number of luns must match with the configured in the previous disks variables (example 0,1,2#3#4#5#6)

_sizes_:: The size dedicated for each logical volume and folder. Example 70,100#100#100#100#100

_paths_:: Folder where each volume group will be mounted. Example /hana/data,/hana/log#/hana/shared#/usr/sap#/hana/backup#/sapmnt/

The values could be set with the variables "hana_vm_size", "hana_enable_accelerated_networking" and "hana_data_disks_configuration" in the _variables.tf_ file if you want to change the default (demo) or better in the _terraform.tfvars_ to set actual values.

===== Netweaver

NetWeaver is SAP's integrated technology platform and is not a product in itself, but it provides the needed services for the SAP business functions and always need a database to talk to.

So it's the overall task of sizing need to take care of Netweaver plus the Database and this is what we combined with the T-Shirt sizes of the solution.

=== Salt Building Blocks

We have seen that resources are the most important elements in terraform, and there is an other resource type used as last step from the terraform process, the _Provisioner_ resource.

It can be used to model specific actions on a remote machine in order to prepare them for other services.

The terraform _file provisioner_ is used to copy directories _MAIN_/salt and _MAIN_/pillar from the machine executing Terraform to the newly created nodes. As last step the terraform _remote-exec provisioner_ is used, to call the script _provision.sh_ on the remote node to run the salt provisioning steps. It comes from the terraform module _MAIN/generic_modules/salt_provisioner/main.tf_ .

The provisioning workflow of the SAP building blocks consist of different steps:

1. Bootstrap salt installation and configuration
2. Execute OS setup operations. Register to SCC if needed, updated the packages etc, with help of executing the states within _/srv/salt/os_setup_
3. Execute predeployment operations with help of execution of the _/srv/salt/top.sls_ states. It update hosts and hostnames, install the formular packages, etc
4. Execute deployment operations depending on the overall configuration settings like install SAP applications and configure and setup HA with the salt formulas.

//fixme


==== Salt Overview
The SAP building block are created with help of SALT formulars after provisioning the virtual machines with terraform. The formulars are shipped as RPM packages with {sles4sap}

The salt formulas can be used with 2 different approaches: salt master/minion or only salt minion execution.

With the automation solution we use the salt minion option, the steps must be executed in all of the minions where the formulas are going to executed, which is done through a ssh connection.

The provisioning workflow of the SAP building blocks consist of different steps:

1. Bootstrap salt installation and configuration
2. Execute OS setup operations. Register to SCC if needed, updated the packages, etc
3. Execute predeployment operations (update hosts and hostnames, install support packages, etc)
4. Execute deployment operations depending on the overall configuration settings (install sap, ha, drbd, etc)
//fixme
which is triggered by the terraform module _MAIN/generic_modules/salt_provisioner/main.tf_  with runs at the end the small script MAIN/salt/provision.sh

The core of the Salt State system is the SLS, or **S**a**L**t **S**tate file. The SLS is a representation of the state in which a system should be in, and is set up to contain this data in a simple format.

The file _top.sls_ contains the overall mapping between groups of machines and the roles which get applied to them.

Salt comes with an interface to derive information about the underlying system. This is called the _grains_ interface, because it presents salt with grains of information.
This is used to match the roles and the further states.

===== HANA formula

The deployment is performed using the saphanabootstrap-formula and depends on the package salt-shaptools. The shaptools package expose an API for the major commandline functionalities of the OS

// fixme
1. It is installed through the salt step xxx

2. If you want to install it manual please use zypper, as it will include the other dependent packages like salt-shaptools and habootstrap-formula
----
 zypper install saphanabootstrap-formula
----

The salt formula need some input data through a pillar file which is coming from the main project file, or if you use it standalone provided by you.
