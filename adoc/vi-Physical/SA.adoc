As mentioned previously, the SAP Automation consists of several building blocks, first is the infrastructure deployment with terraform.

=== First make sure that all *pre-requirements* are met:

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]

. Have an Azure account
. Install the Azure commandline tool _az_
. Install _Terraform_ (v12) (Terraform is available as part of the SLES distribution within the public cloud module)
. Download the SAP HANA install media from SAP
. Create an Azure File Share
. Copy or write down the the name of the storage account and the storage key, which is similar to a password.
. Copy the SAP HANA install media to the Azure fileshare
. Extract the HANA install media (if required)

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
AWS - S3 bucket
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP - GCP storage
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Libvirt" ]
Libvirt - NFS share
endif::[]

SUSE recommend to use the following directory structure:
//fixme check directory structure
----
share
  ├─ HANA
  │    └─ ...
  └─ Netweaver
       ├─ sapkernel
       │    ├─ ...
       ├─ export
       │    ├─ ...
       ├─ client
       │    ├─ ...
       └─ swpm
            ├─ ...
----

=== Get the project from the github site

The project is hosted on a public github site where you can download it to your local machine.

After moving into this directory you will see the following directory structure:

----
├── aws
├── azure
├── doc
├── gcp
├── generic_modules
├── libvirt
├── LICENSE
├── pillar
├── pillar_examples
├── README.md
└── salt
----

The directories with the names of the _cloud provider_ (aws,azure,gcp,libvirt) are the terraform templates for the relevant provider.

The _doc_ directory has some brief but important documents for certain parts of the solution

The directory _generic_modules_ provides modules which are used by all cloud vendor templates, e.g. common variables, local executed functions within the building block, dependent actions on destroy and the functions to start the SALT execution on the module building blocks.

The other directories _pillar_, _pillar_examples_ and _salt_ contain the part of the salt configuration management.

=== Terraform Building Blocks

Terraform relies on 'providers' to interact with remote cloud frameworks.

Providers are plugins and released independently from Terraform itself, this mean that each provider has its own series of version numbers.

Each Terraform module must declare which providers it requires, so that Terraform can install and use them.

If we switch to into a _cloud provider_ directory, we see one directory _modules_ and several _.tf_ files which together, build the terraform template.

When creating Terraform configurations, best practice is to separate out parts of the configuration into individual .tf files. This provides better organization and readability.
----
├── infrastructure.tf
├── main.tf
├── modules
├── outputs.tf
├── README.md
├── terraform.tfvars
├── terraform.tfvars.example
└── variables.tf
----

The _infrastructure.tf_ file:: provides the cloud specific setup with the cloud relevant provider module of terraform and defines all the needed infrastructure specific entities.

The _main.tf_ file:: provides all the values for the various variables needed for the modules.

The _modules_ directory:: provides more subdirectories which are the nested child modules which represent the technical building blocks in the project.

The _output.tf_ file:: provides the values returned from the modules, i.e to be used or displayed.

_terraform.tfvars__:: is a variable definitions file which gets automatically consumed.  This is used instead of providing values manually, it is the main configuration file and should be the only Terraform file which requires modification.

_terraform.tfvars.example_:: is an example configuration file with many pre-filled values to set up the solution. *You can use this as starting point for your own file.*

_variables.tf_:: provides all used input variables, including a short description, the type of the variable and a default value which can be overwritten with the terraform.tfvars file.


A _module_:: is a container for multiple resources that are used together. Modules can be used to create lightweight abstractions, so that infrastructure can be described in terms of it's architecture, rather than directly in terms of physical objects.
+
Modules are used as part of the technical building blocks e.g. a HANA node and the module directory consist again  _main.tf_, _variables.tf_, _outputs.tf_.
+
These are the recommended filenames for a minimal module, even if they're empty. _main.tf_ is the primary entrypoint how to build the infrastructure building block.

There is one additional file (salt_provisioner.tf), which is responsible for handing over the needed values to the salt building blocks. This is acheived by using a special terraform resource called _null_provider_, it remote executes the salt run to configure the instances and execute the application installation for the building block.

=== Simple Install

SUSE provide an example terraform and example pillar files to provide a very easy start.

. Open a browser and goto https://github.com/SUSE/ha-sap-terraform-deployments
. Click on _tags_
. Click on _6.0.0_
+
What's new and what has changed can be seen from this screen, so if older versions of the project are used, ensure to carefully review and understand the differences.
+
The _Usage_ section provides you with a link to an OpenBuildServer (OBS) repository where the RPM packages of the building blocks discussed above are stored, each poject version has a unqiue repository.
+
The value/link to the repository will need to be included within the terraform variables (teraform.tfvars) file. So copy the line as described.

. Next go to _Assets_ and download the _Source code_ as .zip or .tar.gz
. Extract it into a folder on your computer
. Goto this folder and into the sub folder _azure_
. Copy the file _terraform.tfvars.example_ to _terraform.tfvars.example_
    There are many key-value variable pairs, some enabled some disabled with a _=_ in front.
    To have a simple start, only modify what is described below
    
ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]

. Change the region in which to deploy the solution, change _az_region = "westeurope"_ to the azure region required.

. To make it easier to start, change all 4 images types to pay-as-you-go (PAYG) to do so replace all _offer_ settings with  "sles-sap-15-sp2" and _sku_ with 15
+
Do this for hana, iscsi, monitoring, drbd e.g.

    hana_public_offer     = "SLES-SAP-BYOS"
    hana_public_sku       = "12-sp4"
+
with

    hana_public_offer = "sles-sap-15-sp2"
    hana_public_sku   = "gen2"
+
This will make use of the on-demand images which have automatically all needed SUSE repositories attached.
endif::[]

AWS
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Libvirt" ]
Libvirt
endif::[]


. Next is to set the name of the _admin_user_ to a name which you want to use

. The next step is to provide ssh keys to access the machines which will be deployed.
+
SUSE recommend to create new sshkeys for the deployent as both keys will need to be provided as they are copied to the cluster nodes.
Change the two locations variables and point them to your files.


. As we need SAP Install Media for the automatic deployment of HANA, you need to create a azure storage account where you need to copy the HANA media. Best would be if you already have extracted the SAP media to save time during the deployment.
+

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]

Next, provide the name,key and the path to this storage account to the system, change:

    storage_account_name
    storage_account_key
    hana_inst_master
+
The inst_master variable should point to the directory where you have the extracted hana install files.
There are more possibilities, but for the simples usage have everything already extracted on you share
+
So disable the other hana variables with adding a '#' in front of them

   #hana_archive_file = "IMDB_SERVER.SAR"
   #hana_sapcar_exe = "SAPCAR"
   #hana_extract_dir = "/sapmedia/HDBSERVER"

. We need additional ssh keys for the cluster communications, so please save your changes and run the following commands from the azure directory
+
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
   mkdir -p ../salt/hana_node/files/sshkeys
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f ../salt/hana_node/files/sshkeys/cluster.id_rsa
----

. Open the tfvars file again to make final changes.
+
To create a HANA Systemreplication HA automation uncomment

    #hana_ha_enabled = true
+
by removing the _#_
+
As now the system creates a cluster, we need to enable a few other services. Uncomment

    #hana_cluster_sbd_enabled = true
+
by removing the _#_

. Now we need to point the place where the right packages for the v6 could be found. Copy the variable from step 1 e.g.
+
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
    ha_sap_deployment_repo = "https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:ha-clustering:sap-deployments:v6"
----

. If you want the additional monitoring be deployed, simply uncomment

    #monitoring_enabled = true

. As last step we enable a simplification parameter which try to find out a few settings automatically. So scroll down to the end and uncomment

    #pre_deployment = true

Now we have all settings for terraform done and are nearly at the step to run the deployment, so save your changes.

. Go one directory up and change into the _pillar_example_ directory and here into the _automatic_ directory where there are 3 further directories. They provide the configuration variables for the relevant services.

. For a simple deployment, which uses only HANA, please switch to the _hana_ directory and open the file _hana_sls_.
+
The file looks complex, but only a handful of settings need to change. It is possible to provide a simpler file with only the necessary custom settings, but for an initial automatic deployment, with minimal setup and configuration the automatic file is used.

. Change the PRIMARY_SITE_NAME to the desired value, along with value for the SECONDARY_SITE_NAME.
It is possible to change other settings e.g. passwords, but for a simple test do not modify these values.
Save any changes to he file and and go back to the main directory.

. At this point, Terraform can be run.

If the deployment is sucessfull, after around ~40 Minutes an installed and running HANA System Replication Cluster will be deployed.

As a jumphost with a public ip address is created as part of the deployment, it is possible to login to any virtual machine as part of the deployment from your machine with

    ssh -J <adminuser>@jumphost <adminuser@targethost>

==== Terraform file details

All files in the Terraform directory using the .tf file format will be automatically loaded during operations.

The _infrastructure.tf_ provides the _data sources_ for the network setup, which are computed in other terraform parts and some _locals_ variables used for mainly for the autogeneration of the network. 

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
In addition it provides the _resources_ for the network setup with virtual network, the needed subnet and routing, the needed resourcegroup to be used, a storage account, the all the network security groups (nsg) being used and defines the jumphost.

The _main.tf_ file is the main file and calls the child modules which consist of the various building blocks and the required input and output variables defined by the child module.
It in addition provides the calculation for the autogenerated ip addresses.

There is the (default) possibility to autogenerate network addresses for all nodes.
For that i is important to remove or comment all the variables related to the ip addresses (more information in variables.tf). With this approach all the addresses will be retrieved based in the provided virtual network addresses range (vnet_address_range).

Within AWS, the Availability Zones (AZ) of a VPC get used for the HA scenario.
Each of the AZ's has it's own network and therefore each of the machines in a cluster is in a different subnet. The floating virtual IP address is created with help of a special resource agent which changes the routing table entry of a virtual router for VPC, so the adress is outside of the VPC and AZ's

Example based on `10.0.0.0/16` address range (VPC address range) and `192.168.1.0/24` as `virtual_address_range` (the default value):

In order to reuse existing network resources (virtual network and subnets) configuring the _terraform.tfvars_ file and adjust the relevant variables.

The example of how to use them is available at _terraform.tfvars.example_.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the IP addresses is specificed manually, make sure these are valid IP addresses. They should not be currently in use by existing instances. In case of shared account usage in cloud providers, it is recommended to set unique addresses with each deployment to avoid using same addresses.
====

The _output.tf_ file is a way to expose some of the internal attributes, and act like the return values of a terraform module to the user. It will return the IP address and node names created from the automation.

The values defined in the _variables.tf_ file are used to avoid hard-coding parameters and provides all required terraform input variables and their default values within the solution instead of having them in the main.tf file.

////
There are many variable values to input, so hey are defined in a variable definition file named _terraform.tfvars_ and terraform will automatically load the variable values from the variable definition file if it is named terraform.tfvars

==== SAP Sizing

One of the very important points to consider of a SAP deployment is Sizing and applies across three key areas: compute power, storage space and i/o capacity and network bandwith.

If this is a greenfield deployment, please use the SAP Quick Sizer tool to calculate the SAP Application Performance Standard (SAPS) compute requirement and choose the right instance types which have the closest match to the performance needed.

If you have an SAP system running that you want to extend with new functionality and/or add new users or migrate to SAP HANA perform brownfield sizing.

Overall it is an iterative and constant process to translate your business requirements to  the right (virtual) hardware resources.

This is a mandatory step and should not be underestimated.


ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]

SUSE makes it easier to deploy the right instance sizes with the right disks types and performance, and the right network settings, a simplified SAP sizing has been introduced with well known T-Shirt sizes, S,M,L and a very small Demo size.

Behind the sizes, are useful combinations to provide certain SAP performance scenarios.
Below is a simple reference of the possible performance values

* Demo
* Small  <  30.000 SAPS
* Medium <  70.000 SAPS
* Large  < 180.000 SAPS

It is possible to customize the settings within the terraform.tfvars, or provide a permanent solution in the variables file.

The Demo and Small size are designed for non-production scenarios and do not use SAP certified instancetypes, whereas the Medium and Large are meant for production usage and therefore use SAP certified instance types. The setups also use the correct disks and I/O behavior for production.

The SAPS values are meant for the landscape and not only for the database.

===== HANA

Given that low storage latency is critical for database systems, even for in-memory systems as SAP HANA. The critical path in storage is usually around the transaction log writes of the DB systems, but other operations like savepoints or loading data in-memory after crash recovery can be critical.

Therefore, it is mandatory to leverage Azure premium storage or Ultra disk for /hana/data and /hana/log volumes. Depending on the performance requirements, we may need to build a RAID-0 stripe-set to aggregate IOPS and throughput to meet the application scenario need.

The overall VM I/O throughput and IOPS limits need to kept in mind when deciding for a instance type.

Actual recommendations could be looked at the following link
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations-storage

The maps below, describes how the disks for SAP HANA will be used and created during the provisioning.

disks_type:: as HANA has high I/O requirements the disk type Premium SSD need to be used
disks_size:: is the size of the additional disk in GB, as every size has certain IOPS caps
caching:: The caching recommendations for Azure premium disks are assuming the I/O
characteristics for SAP HANA
/hana/data - no caching or read caching
/hana/log - no caching - exception for M- and Mv2-Series VMs where Azure Write Accelerator should be enabled
/hana/shared - read caching

writeaccelerator:: Azure Write Accelerator is a functionality that is available for Azure M-Series VMs exclusively. As the name states, the purpose of the functionality is to improve I/O latency of writes against the Azure premium storage. For SAP HANA, Write Accelerator is supposed to be used against the /hana/log volume only. Therefore, the /hana/data and /hana/log are separate volumes with Azure Write Accelerator supporting the /hana/log volume only.

Number of Disks:: The number of disks which get used, depend on the performance requirements. We join disks to a stripe set to provide more performance. Minimal we need 4 to 5 disks.

LogicalVolumes::  We are using LVM to build stripe sets across several Azure premium disks. These stripe sizes differ between /hana/data and /hana/log and the recommendations is
256 KB for /hana/data
64 KB for /hana/log

Name of the VolumeGroup:: The name of the volume group used

Mount path:: The mount point where the volume gets mounted

The number of elements *must match* in all of them

_#_ character:: is used to split the volume groups
_,_ (comma):: is used to define the logical volumes for each volume group

The number of groups splitted by "#" *must match* in all of the entries

_names_:: The names of the volume groups (example datalog#shared#usrsap#backup#sapmnt)

_luns_:: The luns or disks used for each volume group. The number of luns must match with the configured in the previous disks variables (example 0,1,2#3#4#5#6)

_sizes_:: The size dedicated for each logical volume and folder. Example 70,100#100#100#100#100

_paths_:: Folder where each volume group will be mounted. Example /hana/data,/hana/log#/hana/shared#/usr/sap#/hana/backup#/sapmnt/

The values could be set with the variables "hana_vm_size", "hana_enable_accelerated_networking" and "hana_data_disks_configuration" in the _variables.tf_ file if a change to the default (demo) is needed, or better still, in the _terraform.tfvars_ to set actual values.

===== Netweaver

NetWeaver is SAP's integrated technology platform and is not a product in itself, but it provides the required services for the SAP business applications and always needs a database to talk to.

It is the overall task of sizing to fulfil the requirements of Netweaver plus the Database and this is what is combined within the T-Shirt sizes of the solution.

=== Salt Building Blocks

The resources are the most important elements in Terraform, and there is another resource type used as a last step in the terraform process, the _Provisioner_ resource.

It can be used to model specific actions on a remote machine in order to prepare them for other services.

The terraform _file provisioner_ is used to copy directories _MAIN_/salt and _MAIN_/pillar from the machine executing Terraform to the newly created nodes.

As a final step the terraform _remote-exec provisioner_ is used to call the script _provision.sh_ on the remote node to run the salt provisioning steps. It comes from the terraform module _MAIN/generic_modules/salt_provisioner/main.tf_.

From this point on all work is done on the respective node itself.

The provisioning workflow of the SAP building blocks consist of different steps:

1. Bootstrap salt installation and configuration
2. Execute OS setup operations. Register to SCC if needed, updated the packages etc, with help of executing the states within _/srv/salt/os_setup_
3. Execute predeployment operations with help of execution of the _/srv/salt/top.sls_ states. It updates hosts and hostnames, installs the formula packages, etc
4. Execute deployment operations depending on the overall configuration settings e.g. install SAP applications and configure and setup HA with the salt formulas.


==== Salt Overview
The SAP building blocks are created with help of SALT formulas after provisioning the virtual machines with terraform. The formulas are shipped as RPM packages with {sles4sap}

The salt formulas can be used with 2 different approaches: salt master/minion or only salt minion execution.

With the automation solution we use the salt minion option, the steps must be executed in all of the minions where the formulas are going to executed.  This is actioned through a ssh connection.

The core of the Salt State system is the SLS, or **S**a**L**t **S**tate file. The SLS is a representation of the state in which a system should be in, and is set up to contain this data in a simple format.

_Salt pillar_ system uses a *top* file to match pillar data to Salt minions
The pillar files, have a .sls extension too and define custom variables and data for a system.

When Salt pillar data is refreshed, each Salt minion is matched against the targets listed in the top.sls file. When a Salt minion matches a target, it receives all of the Salt pillar SLS files defined in the list underneath that target.

The top pillar file describes two environments for the nodes, _pre-deployment_ and _base_ which reflect the steps 3 and 4 of the workflow above. For each role of the nodes there more detailed files responsible.

SaltStack comes with an interface to derive information about the underlying system. This is called the _grains_ interface, because it presents salt with grains of information.
It collects information about the underlying managed system, e.g. the operating system, domain name, IP address, kernel, OS type, memory, and many other system properties.

It is used to match the roles and the further states.

The _role_ is a _custom grains_ define with help of the terraform file _salt_provisioner.tf_ for the respective building block.

ATTENTION
----
If you use the salt formulas independent from the terraform templates, it is important to ensure that all the requied variables are suppllied as they would normally get set by the _salt_provisioner.tf_.

//fixme
_Salt state_ files are organized into a directory tree, called the Salt state tree, in the /srv/salt/ directory.


Salt includes the Jinja2 templating engine which can be used in Salt state files, Salt pillar files, and other files managed by Salt.

Salt allows the use of Jinja to access minion configuration values, grains and Salt pillar data, and call Salt execution modules. One of the most common uses of Jinja is to insert conditional statements into Salt pillar files.


When targeting a directory during a _state.apply_ or in the state Top file, salt looks for an init.sls file in that directory and applies it.

===== HANA formula

The deployment is performed using the saphanabootstrap-formula and depends on the package salt-shaptools. The shaptools package expose an API for the major commandline functionalities of the OS

// fixme
1. It is installed through the salt step xxx

2. To install it manually please use zypper, as this will include the other dependent packages such as salt-shaptools and habootstrap-formula
----
 zypper install saphanabootstrap-formula
----

The salt formula will need input data through a pillar file which is part of the main project file, or it is possible to use it standalone with data provided manually.
