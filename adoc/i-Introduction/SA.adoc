== Introduction

Maintaining a competitive advantage often depends on how quickly you can deliver new services. SAP applications are designed to help your business analyze data to anticipate new requirements, and rapidly deliver new products and services. This gives you the ability to keep your existing customers happy while attracting new business.

SUSE’s Vision is to Simplify, Modernize, Accelerate the business of our customers.

When we first released SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications, it included already automated installation features for the SAP software stack. Over the last 10 years, our SAP LinuxLab and development engineers have introduced several additional features to automate routine system administration.

*Simplify*::      the deployment of an SAP Landscape in Azure for dev, test, and production.

*Modernize*::     customer environments by taking advantage of the power of the public cloud

*Accelerate*::    customer migrations to the cloud.


Starting from the idea of simplifying and modernizing SAP HANA and SAP NetWeaver deployments, SUSE worked on rewriting the deployment wizards we had build.

Building the infrastructure to running SAP Applications can get quite complex and demands big effort if they get deployed manually, and in addition reproducing it, can be tedious and error-prone. 
An additional challenge is to make the infrastructure high available, as this will add more complexity and tasks.

The major motivation was to improve, simplify and unify the installation of SAP Landscape on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications and clearly standardize deployments and allow customers to use one level of tooling in various ways – from a Command Line interface, through some GUI driven process and SUSE Manager or other automation frameworks.

So it was clear for us to move to a more modern approach, like infrastructure-as-code, in order to help our customers to reduce the effort and errors.

As SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and many other SUSE products ship with a universal configuration management solution since a few years, we used it as the base for the new automation. 

This configuration infrastructure management system is called Salt from SaltStack and provides a highly scalable, powerful and fast infrastructure automation and management, built on a dynamic communication bus.
Salt can be used for data-driven orchestration, remote execution for any infrastructure, configuration management for any app stack, and much more.

Combining this management system with a infrastructure deployment solution like Terraform from Hashicorp makes it possible to do a hands free setup of an SAP Landscape, ready to login to start customizing your SAP System.

Such a number of systems have an additional challenge - getting an overview whats going on after the install is done. 

Therefore we added the possibility to allow insights into your SAP Landscape with comprehensive dashboards, realtime and historic views and active alerts and reporting based on flexible and powerful open-source projects Prometheus and Grafana.
The deployment automation can be configured to also setup a monitoring environment for the clusters, HANA and Netweaver.
